# restaurant_tip_analysis
I made a simple analysis on a restaurant tips data

1. **Project Title**: **A restaurant tip analysis**
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

2. **A description of the data that used**:
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv)
It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.
3. **The main goals**
To find the relationship between different variables and the tips given.
4. **Results**
Based on measure of central tendency and histogram, we found the connection between the day of the week and time of day affects the tips. For example, the weekend and dinner will offer more tips. While the other time will have less.
Smoking status doesn't affect the tips given since we found a balance between smokers' and non-smokers' tips.
